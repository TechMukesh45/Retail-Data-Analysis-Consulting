As a Data Analyst Intern at KPMG, I played a pivotal role in the "Customer Insights &amp; Data Optimization for Retail Data" project. This initiative aimed to enhance data quality, extract actionable insights through RFM analysis on transactional data, and leverage advanced analytics for providing strategic recommendations.
